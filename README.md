# hubitat-ModernForms
First attempt on writing a device driver for hubitat. In this case for the Modern Form Fans

Note: Setting the speed will not change the on/off of the Fan. You need to set the Speed to "on" to turn it on. This allows you to change the speed without affecting the state of the fan
